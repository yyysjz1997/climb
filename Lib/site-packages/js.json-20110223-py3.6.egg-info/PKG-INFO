        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `JSON`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`JSON`: http://www.json.org/js.html
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.json``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``json`` from ``js.json`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.json import json
          >>> json.need()
